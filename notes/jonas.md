#### Bitcoin's Summary:
Communication: Gossibing (Analysis: max delay for good mssgs
Main idea: Consensus via Proof-of-Work
Main Assumption: Honest majority of comuting power

Main Technical Problems:
- Wastefuless: Electrical, Cost, Fees, ...
- Exogeneous Vulnerability
- Scalability
- Ambiguity (Forks)
- Long True Latency (Wait for some blocks)


#### Algorand:
Effortless, Ony-By-One, Byzantine Agreement

No Forks?
No Proof-of-Work?
Very clean single blockchain, by bizantine agreement.

Byzantine agreement challanges:
- Very slow
- Players fixed and known in advance


#### Algorands Summary

Communication: Gossibing (Analysis: max delay for good mssgs
Main idea: Messages-passing Byzantine Agreement
Main Assumption: Honest majority of Money

Main technical advantages
- Trivial Computation, few add, count, compare, sign, verify
- True decentralization, single class of users, i.e. no exogenous powers
- Finality of Payments, Porb[fork] =< 10e-18, i.e. 1 block/sec => 1 fork in the age of the universe
- Scalability, Network Latency=Bottleneck
- Security, Against
